                            Sri Lanka is an incredible dive location, bathed in warm Indian Ocean currents and boasting 1600 kilometers of palm-fringed coastline. The waters of Sri Lanka are home to a diverse array of marine life, ranging from huge blue whales to tiny nudibranchs.

There are several fantastic spots to visit in Sri Lanka, including wrecks off the coast that local divers are continuously uncovering. Marine life, soft corals, macro creatures, and big aggregations of schooling fish cover several of the wrecks.

                            Hot air ballooning is a relatively recent recreational activity. Imagine flying smoothly through Sri Lanka's stunning scenery. Dambulla - Kandalama is perfect for ballooning because of its calm and predictable atmosphere. As the multi-colored hot-air balloon hovers gently above the woodland, the adventure takes on a whole new meaning.....

                        <p>
                            Sri Lanka is known for its lovely, blonde beaches, but the harsh, mountainous interior holds a different world. Vehicles replaced hiking as the primary mode of transportation on this beautiful tropical island only after railways were built across the highlands. Within striking distance of the shore, modern-day trekkers can reach a world of rocky ruins, religious places, spectacular views, and falling tea farms.

Because of Sri Lanka's small size — the island is only 268 miles long and 139 miles wide – trekkers don't have to worry about intricate logistics. For walks in national parks (and off-the-beaten-path treks elsewhere), you'll need a guide, although most hikes are simple day hikes.

                            <p>
                                From enormous dagobas (dome-shaped structures) and remains of ancient buildings in the ruined cities of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, to the awesome stairway to the temple at Dambulla and the sensual frescoes of heavenly maidens at the palace at the rock of Sigiriya, visitors can experience these World Heritage Sites within a compact area called the Cultural Triangle.

In the hill country lies the former royal capital of Kandy, home to the Dalada Maligawa or Sacred Temple of the Tooth, which houses the sacred tooth relic of the Buddha. With its distinctive architecture, art and music, Kandy is a bastion of traditional culture.

In contrast, experience the colonial heritage of the country by heading south to the mid-17th c. Dutch fort at Galle, the best preserved in Asia. With 14 massive bastions, a grid system of streets, and some original Dutch bungalows, the fort bustles with life just as it did when Galle was the country’s main port. It’s simply one of the most unique attractions in Sri Lanka.
