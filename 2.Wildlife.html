                        <p>
                            Yala National Park, on Sri Lanka's southeast coast, was designated as a protected area in 1938. It is a huge reserve with a diverse range
                            of ecosystems, including open parkland and deep rainforest, as well as flooded lagoons and towering coastal sand dunes. This diverse 
                            landscape supports a diverse array of plants and wildlife.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The world's biggest concentration of leopards is said to reside in Yala National Park. Although sightings of the elusive leopard are 
                            still rare, the average density of these gorgeous beasts is as high as one cat per square kilometer. Sambar and spotted deer, wild boar, 
                            crocodile, langur and toque monkeys, golden jackal, and even the sloth bear may be seen in Yala during the months of June and July when the 
                            palu tree bears fruit. There are approximately 200 kinds of birds documented here, and the reserve provides an ideal blend of freshwater, 
                            coastal, scrub, and forest regions for bird variety.

                        <p>
                            Udawalawe National Park, located immediately south of Sri Lanka's central highlands, is a huge reserve of grassland, scrub jungle, 
                            and riverine forest covering 119 square miles. The park's biggest draw is its enormous population of Asian elephants; Udawalawe is 
                            home to around 400 of these gentle giants and seeing them while on safari is practically assured. The Walawe Reservoir is a favorite 
                            hangout for elephant herds during times of water shortage, where the animals congregate to drink.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Other interesting fauna found in Udawalawe National Park includes the mugger crocodile, sambar, spotted and barking deer, wild boar, 
                            water buffalo, and jackal, as well as approximately 200 species of birds. From November to March, birding tours are ideal for spotting 
                            interesting raptors such the changeable hawk-eagle, serpent eagle, and grey-headed fish eagle.

                        <p>
                            The Horton Plains, located in the central highlands, rise to an astonishing 2,100 meters above sea level, making it Sri Lanka's 
                            highest plateau and earning it the nickname "Roof of the Island." Cloud forest and lush montane grasslands dominate the plains, 
                            which are rich in indigenous species and animals that have adapted to the chilly temperature.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The elephant disappeared from the Horton Plains in the 1940s, but the area still supports a diverse range of animals, birds, amphibians, 
                            and reptiles. The sambar deer, which wanders in vast groups and skirts over the high grasses, is the most common creature seen. Some of 
                            the 24 animal species found here include giant squirrels, wild boars, rusty-spotted cats, and purple-faced langurs, as well as the Horton 
                            Plains slender loris, one of the world's most endangered primates. The cloud forests are home to rare reptile species like the rhino-horned
                            lizard, as well as a diverse assortment of migratory and endemic birds for bird watchers.

                        <p>
                            Wilpattu is Sri Lanka's biggest national park, located in the country's arid lowlands in the northwest. Wilpattu means 'natural lakes' 
                            in Sinhalese, and there are several shimmering lakes strewn around the area. Because of its low visitor numbers, this national park
                            exudes a true feeling of wildness and authenticity; but, because wildlife is afraid of humans, sightings are less common than in more 
                            popular parks.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Nonetheless, Wilpattu National Park is a fantastic adventure, and the potential wildlife is among the greatest in Sri Lanka. 
                            Leopardâ€™s stalk through the brush, crocodiles bask in the park's many lakes, deer wander, and peafowl parade. Monitor lizards, 
                            tortoises, flycatchers, and jungle fowl are among the other intriguing animals that may be seen.
