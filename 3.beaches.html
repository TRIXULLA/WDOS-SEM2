                            With its smooth white sand and transparent sea, Pasikuda is the pin up of picture postcard beaches. Between May through September, this is the greatest time to visit Sri Lanka for a beach vacation. The ocean is warm, and the water clarity is excellent, making it ideal for snorkeling, diving, sailing, and a variety of other water sports. Because of the bend in Pasikuda Bay, swimming can be enjoyed all year. The resorts lining Pasikuda, such as Uga Bay, all benefit from generous manicured gardens, wide-open beachfronts, and the most surreal ocean views. Pasikuda is a relatively new destination in Sri Lanka for luxury beach holidays, and the resorts lining Pasikuda, such as Uga Bay, all benefit from generous manicured gardens, wide-open beachfronts, and the most surreal ocean views.

                        <p>
                            With sparkling white sand and deep blue sea that gradually turns green as you go closer to the shore, Arugambay is a very attractive beach. The beach is recognized as a worldwide surf destination because of its attractiveness, which includes some of Sri Lanka's top surf breaks. This reputation not only attracts a large number of people, but it also indicates that the area has a well-developed tourist infrastructure and is easily accessible. The curving beach is reminiscent of a Hawaiian beach, with a dry, sandy section near the ocean, followed by rougher areas with plants and a tree line.

                        <p>
                            Mirissa, located on the island's southern tip, is the major fishing port on the south coast. It's not difficult to get to because of its beauty and proximity to Colombo (the capital city). The capital's airport is about a two-hour drive away. The small beach town and its wide beach are both lovely, with a dense grove of palm trees surrounding them. The village is located on a little hill behind the beach.
